## Overview

<br />

**Quirky, Experimental, Inefficient, and SUPER Personal**

This Spring Boot Starter project includes basic CRUD operations for members, boards, and comments. I aim to improve my skills by exploring unconventional approaches through such endeavors.
The following are the features I have completed in this project:

+ [x] 기능의 모듈화
+ [x] 다중 Database 활용
+ [x] 휴면회원 처리
+ [x] Spring Security 사용
+ [x] QueryDSL 사용

The following are the features I plan to implement in this project:

+ [ ] Axon Framework 적용
+ [ ] DDD 및 EDA 활용
+ [ ] gRPC, Web Client 구현

Of course, these may be changed or added to.

I aim to prioritize <code>scalability</code>, <code>efficiency</code>, and <code>readability</code> even without comments.

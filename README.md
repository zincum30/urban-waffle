## Abstract

<br />

**Quirky, Experimental, Inefficient, and SUPER Personal**

This Spring Boot Starter project includes basic CRUD operations for members, boards, and comments. I aim to improve my skills by exploring unconventional approaches through such endeavors.
The following are the functionalities or libraries I wanted to implement or use through this project.

+ [x] 기능의 모듈화
+ [x] 다중 Database 활용
+ [x] 휴면회원 처리
+ [x] Spring Security 사용
+ [x] RDB 계층형 데이터 설계
+ [ ] Axon Framework 사용


I aim to prioritize <code>scalability</code>, <code>efficiency</code>, and <code>readability</code> even without comments.
